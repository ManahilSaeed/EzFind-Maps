# 📍 Ez-Find Maps – Interactive Map & Route Planner  

An interactive, responsive map application built as part of the University of Toronto’s **ECE297 Software Design & Communication** course.  
Due to **academic confidentiality**, the full source code cannot be published. This repository instead showcases the project’s design, features, and visual demos.

## ✨ Features  

- 🔎 **Smart Search & Autocomplete** – quickly find intersections, addresses, and points of interest.  
- 🗺 **Pathfinding Algorithms** – efficient routing powered by **Dijkstra’s** and **A\*** algorithms.  
- 🎨 **Customizable Map Layers** – night mode + toggleable layers for POIs (cafes, restaurants, landmarks, etc).  
- 📧 **Email Directions Function** – send routes directly to your inbox for **offline access** (no need to rely on screenshots).  
- 🚇 **Transit Integration** – includes **TTC subway and streetcar lines** for multimodal navigation.

## 🔍 Focus  

- **Usability:** Designed for quick and intuitive navigation.  
- **Responsiveness:** Optimized for smooth performance even with large datasets.  
- **Reliability:** Features like the email directions function ensure stress-free use, even in low-connectivity areas (e.g., TTC subway).

## 📌 Technologies Used  

- **C++ & GTK** for core map rendering and GUI.  
- **A\* / Dijkstra** for efficient routing.  
- **Multithreading** for performance optimization.  
- **libcurl (SMTP)** for email integration.
